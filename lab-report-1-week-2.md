Step 2. **`Connecting Remotely`**

Initially, you must find your course-specific account through this link.

Once found, in VScode click on **Terminal-->New Terminal** in the menu, and input this command using YOUR account (not the example one below).

>$ ssh cs15lwi22aaa@ieng6.ucsd.edu

Then type in your password and press enter (you will not be able to see letters as you are typing your password). The output should look similar to the image below.
